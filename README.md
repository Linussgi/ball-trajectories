# ball-trajectories
Calculates trajectories of bouncing objects
A simple implementation of the Euler method is used to calculate the trajectory of one or more objects bouncing of a flat surface, given parameters such as object density, restitution coefficient, size etc. The height of the object with time is then displayed on a graph.
