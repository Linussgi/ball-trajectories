# ball-trajectories
Calculates trajectories of bouncing objects.
A simple implementation of the Euler method is used to calculate the trajectory of one or more objects bouncing off of a flat surface through different fluids, given parameters such as object density, restitution coefficient, object size etc. The height of the object with time is then displayed on a graph. 
This is a sample of work I produced for an assignment I was given at university.
